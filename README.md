## Overview

This project was inspired by a similar tool for wikipedia which allows users to search for missing citations
across wikimedia and add them straight from Incite

## Key Features

The key solutions for this web application were (but not limited to) :

1. Integrated minimalist UI components across all web pages. This is because this application is just a helper for toolhub, and it's intention is to give the user as much concise and precise information as possible while being equally responsive.
2. An Accessible Navigation bar containing links to other pages within the web application
3. A search tool for searching and addiing missing citations
4. A Leaderboard for comparing loggers scores and ranking
5. A dashboard that shows analytics reports relevant to the user

## Areas of Improvement

A more stylish footer should add a liitle bit of vibrance to the page
Dynamic dashboard with sidebar for the record dashboard page
An admin area would also be a useful development for managing users activity
Adding No-color icons to the dashboard would make the dashboard have a more gamified look
